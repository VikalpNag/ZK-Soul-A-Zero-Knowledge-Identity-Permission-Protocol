# 🧠 ZK-Soul: Zero-Knowledge Identity & Permission Protocol

ZK-Soul is a smart contract protocol built on top of **Soulbound NFTs** that represent non-transferable, on-chain identities. The project aims to provide decentralized identity primitives with zero-knowledge compatibility, useful for DAO governance, permissioned access, and secure identity verification.
